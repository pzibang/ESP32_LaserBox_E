# This is a remake of ESP32_GRBL, mainly from ESP32_GRBL

## Support
- LaserBox_E        (This code will be used for this motherboard)
- MKS DLC32         (It will not provide complete support. The reason is that the hardware cannot provide good support. The IO pin distribution of MKS dlc32 is not very reasonable. Of course, it is only my personal opinion)

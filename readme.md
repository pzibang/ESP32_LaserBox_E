# Describeï¼š

This is a remake of ESP32_GRBL, mainly from ESP32_GRBL.I updated the core of ESP32, and will rebuild a new UI to replace the current MKS DLC32 UI. Of course, this is only for my personal use. After I modified the core, some strange bugs also appeared. At present, they are being repaired continuously. Now I have installed it on my totem 1s, which works very well. I also installed it on my 3018 CNC machine, which still performs well. In terms of current optimization, it has well fixed some network problems of DLC32.

In addition, I designed a new motherboard to avoid some unreasonable aspects of the DLC32 hardware. Of course, the size is different from that of the DLC32. After all, my primary purpose is to use it myself. Of course, if I am willing to pay for customization, I am also happy to do so.

## Support
- LaserBox_E        (This code will be used for this motherboard)
- MKS DLC32         (The new project is not fully supported on the original MKS DLC32. One reason is that some interfaces are not completely the same as DLC32. Of course, if you have the ability, you can make it perfectly adapt to the interface of MKS DLC32.)
